## An EKF-Based GNSS/INS Integrated Navigation System

## Introduction

We open-source KF-GINS[^1], an EKF-based GNSS/INS integrated navigation system. KF-GINS implements the classical integrated navigation solution of GNSS positioning results and IMU data. The KF-GINS follows the course content of "Inertial Navigation Principles and GNSS/INS Integrated Navigation" by Prof. Xiaoji Niu and Dr. Qijin Chen, as a supporting resource for the cource. The software is developed in C++ programming language, and CMake is used to manage the project. 

The main features of KF-GINS are as follows:

- A GNSS/INS loosely-coupled integrated navigation algorithm based on the extended Kalman filter architecture (error state vector), including IMU error compensation, inertial navigation solution, Kalman filter, error feedback, etc.
- 21-dimensional error states are defined in the system, including position errors, velocity errors, attitude errors, IMU bias errors, and IMU scale factor errors
- The attitude errors adopt the Phi-angle model, and the velocity errors and position errors are defined in the navigation frame.
- The inertial navigation solution adopts the two-sample mechanization algorithm based on the linear assumption, which compensates for the second-order coning correction, the rotational motion, and the sculling motion.

## 1 Program Compilation and Execution

### 1.1 Compilation environment

KF-GINS is managed by CMake and can be compiled on all of Linux, MacOS and Windows. We recommend you choose Linux environment first.

The configuration file is used as a parameter to run KF-GINS after successfully compiling it. To debug the program, it is also required to add the configuration file as a parameter.

### 1.2 Dependency libraries
KF-GINS requires another three libraries, which are Eigen3, abseil-cpp, and yaml-cpp. We have appended them as the thirdparty libraries in the **ThirdParty** directory.

### 1.3 Compile under Linux

We recommend you use g++ compiler of Ubuntu18.04 or Ubuntu20.04 to compile KF-GINS. You should install the build-essential libraries following the commonds:
```shell
sudo apt-get install cmake
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

After preparing your own compilation environment, you can clone the repository locally and compile KF-GINS as follows:

```shell
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/i2Nav-WHU/KF-GINS.git ~/

# Build KF-GINS
cd ~/KF-GINS
mkdir build && cd build

cmake ../ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release 
make -j8

# Run demo dataset
cd ~/KF-GINS
./bin/KF-GINS ./dataset/kf-gins.yaml

# Wait until the program finish
```

### 1.4 Compile under Windows

The MSVC(Microsoft Visual C/C++) compiler is generally used in Windows. We recommend you to compile KF-GINS in the VSCode software.

You should first install the MSVC compiler and VScode software (including the necessary plug-ins, such as C/C++, C/C++ Extension Pack, CMake, and CMake Tools).

After preparing your own compilation environment, you can clone the repository locally and open the KF-GINS folder in VSCode:

- Set compiler: open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and type "CMake: Select a Kit", select the MSVC compilier
- Set compile parameter: type "CMake: Select Variant" in the Command Palette, select "Release"
- Configure CMake: type "CMake: Configure" in the Command Palette
- Compile Project: type "CMake: Build" in the Command Palette

Open a PowerShell or CMD terminal in the project directory and run the test dataset:
```shell
.\bin\KF-GINS.exe .\dataset\kf-gins.yaml
# The executable file may be generated in the '.\bin\Release' directory. Then the command is:
# .\bin\Release\KF-GINS.exe .\dataset\kf-gins.yaml
```

### 1.5 Compile under MacOS

xcode-select and cmake in MacOS.  You should install these tools following the commonds:

```shell
xcode-select --install
brew install cmake
```

After preparing your own compilation environment, you can clone the repository locally and compile KF-GINS as follows:
```shell
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/i2Nav-WHU/KF-GINS.git ~/

# Build KF-GINS
cd ~/KF-GINS
mkdir build && cd build

cmake ../ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release 
make -j8

# Run demo dataset
cd ~/KF-GINS
./bin/KF-GINS ./dataset/kf-gins.yaml

# Wait until the program finish
```

### 1.6 Debug by VSCode

GDB debugging tool is required to debug KF-GINS under Linux. You should install it following the command.
``` shell
sudo apt-get install gdb
```
The debug operation is as follows:

- Set compiler: open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and type "CMake: Select a Kit", select GCC for Linux or select the MSVC compilier for Windows
- Set compile parameter: type "CMake: Select Variant" in the Command Palette, select **Debug**
- Configure CMake: type "CMake: Configure" in the Command Palette, Compile Project: type "CMake: Build" in the Command Palette
- Set debug startup option: click the fourth button on the left side of VSCode to open the "Run and Debug" menu (or the shortcut key Ctrl+Shift+D), and select "Windows 启动" or "Linux gdb 启动" at the top of this menu window.
- Start debugging, click the green triangle symbol at the top of the left window (or the shortcut key F5) to start debugging.


## 2 Use KF-GINS

### 2.1 Prerequisite Knowledge

**Frame defination:**
- IMU frame: the origin is the IMU center, the three axes point forward-right-down
- Navigation reference frame: the origin coincides with the IMU frame, the three axes point north-east-down

**Navigation state:**
- position: the geodetic coordinates of the IMU position in the Earth frame (latitude-longitude-ellipsoid height)
- velocity: the IMU velocity to the Earth projected in the navigation reference frame (north speed-east speed-down speed)
- attitude: IMU attitude to navigation frame (quaternion, direction consine matrix, or euler angles. euler angles are defined as yaw-pitch-roll, ZYX rotation order)

**IMU noise model:**
- IMU measurement noises are modeled as the Gaussian white noise
- IMU bias errors are modeled as the firt-order Gauss-Markov process
- IMU scale factor errors are modeled as the firt-order Gauss-Markov process

### 3.3 Your own dataset

The data formats used in KF-GINS are the same as the formats defined at **[awesome-gins-datasets](https://github.com/i2Nav-WHU/awesome-gins-datasets)**. You can follow the formats to prepare your own datasets.
